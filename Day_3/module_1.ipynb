      "•\n",
      "A software system usually consists of a number of separate programs, configuration \n",

      "how to use the system and web sites for users to download recent product \n",
      "information.\n",

      "Software engineers are concerned with developing software products, i.e., \n",
      "software which can be sold to a customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software and its Types\n",
      "Types of software product\n",
      "Generic products\n",
      "• These are stand-alone systems that are produced by a development organization and sold on the \n",
      "open market to any customer who is able to buy them.\n",
      "•  Examples of this type of product include software for PCs such as databases, word processors, \n",
      "drawing packages and project management tools.\n",
      "Customized (or bespoke) products\n",
      "• These are systems which are commissioned by a particular customer.\n",
      "•  A software contractor develops the software especially for that customer.\n",
      "• Examples of this type of software include control systems for electronic devices, systems written \n",
      "to support a particular business process and air traffic control systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software and its Types\n",
      "• An important difference between these types of software is that, in generic products, the \n",
      "organization that develops the software controls the software specification.\n",
      "• For custom products, the specification is usually developed and controlled by the organization \n",
      "that is buying the software. \n",
      "• The software developers must work to that specification.\n",
      "• However, the line between these types of products is becoming increasingly blurred.\n",
      "• More and more software companies are starting with a generic system and customizing it to the \n",
      "needs of a particular customer.\n",
      "•  Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, such as the SAP system, are the best examples of \n",
      "this approach. \n",
      "•  Here, a large and complex system is adapted for a company by incorporating information about \n",
      "business rules and processes, reports required, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamental Software Engineering Activities\n",
      "Software engineering \n",
      "• Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspect of software \n",
      "production from the early stages of system specification to maintain in the system after it has \n",
      "gone into use.\n",
      "•  In this definition, there are two key phrases:\n",
      "• Engineering discipline:\n",
      "• Engineers make things work.\n",
      "• They apply theories, methods and tools where these are appropriate, but they use them \n",
      "selectively and always try to discover solutions to problems even when there are no applicable \n",
      "theories and methods.\n",
      "•  Engineers also recognize that they must work to organizational and financial constraints, so they \n",
      "look for solutions within these constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamental Software Engineering Activities\n",
      "• All aspects of software production\n",
      "• Software engineering is not just concerned with the technical processes of software development \n",
      "but also with activities such as software project management and with the development of tools, \n",
      "methods and theories to support software production.\n",
      "• In general, software engineers adopt a systematic and organized approach to their work, as this is \n",
      "often the most effective way to produce high-quality software.\n",
      "• However, engineering is all about selecting the most appropriate method for a set of \n",
      "circumstances and a more creative, less formal approach to development may be effective in \n",
      "some circumstances.\n",
      "• Less formal development is particularly appropriate for the development of web-based systems, \n",
      "which requires a blend of software and graphical design skills. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamental Software Engineering Activities\n",
      "There are four fundamental process activities that are common to all software processes. These are:\n",
      "• Software specification: Where customers and engineers define the software to be produced and \n",
      "the constraints on its operation.\n",
      "• Software development: Where the software is designed and programmed.\n",
      "• Software validation: Where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer \n",
      "requires.\n",
      "• Software evolution: where the software is modified to adapt it to changing customer and market \n",
      "requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software Engineering and its Importance\n",
      "• Software engineering is essential for the functioning of government, society and national and \n",
      "international businesses and institutions. \n",
      "• We can’t run the modern world without software. \n",
      "• National infrastructures and utilities are controlled by computer-based systems and most \n",
      "electrical products include a computer and controlling software. \n",
      "• Industrial manufacturing and distribution is completely computerized, as is the financial system. \n",
      "• Entertainment, including the music industry, computer games and film and television, is software-\n",
      "intensive. \n",
      "• More than 75% of the world’s population have a software-controlled mobile phone and, and in \n",
      "near future, almost all of these will be Internet-enabled.\n",

      "• Software systems are abstract and intangible. \n",
      "• They are not constrained by the properties of materials, governed by physical laws or by \n",
      "manufacturing processes. \n",
      "• This simplifies software engineering, as there are no natural limits to the potential of software. \n",
      "• However, because of the lack of physical constraints, software systems can quickly become \n",
      "extremely complex, difficult to understand and expensive to change.\n",
      "• There are many different types of software system, from simple embedded systems to complex, \n",

      "• All of these applications need software engineering; they do not all need the same software \n",

      "developing complex software but, without software engineering, we would not have explored space, \n",
      "would not have the Internet or modern telecommunications. \n",

      "• An important difference between these types of software is that, in generic products, the \n",
